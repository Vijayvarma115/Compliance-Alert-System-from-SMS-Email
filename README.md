# Problem Statement

Businesses often miss compliance-related actions (like tax filings, returns, etc.) due to unnoticed email or SMS notifications. This leads to penalties and late fees.

# Solution 

Built an automation workflow that analyzes emails, detects compliance-related messages using regex, and then sends alerts, creates calendar reminders, and logs them into Notion.
